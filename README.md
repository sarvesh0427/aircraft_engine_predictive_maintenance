# ✈️ Aircraft Engine Predictive Maintenance (RUL Prediction)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predictive maintenance for aircraft jet engines** by estimating the  
**Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** using multivariate sensor time-series data.

Predictive maintenance helps airlines:
- Reduce unexpected engine failures
- Lower maintenance costs
- Improve operational safety

The project is built using **Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning**, with a clear separation
between data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and deployment.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given historical sensor readings from aircraft engines operating until failure,  
the goal is to **predict how many operational cycles remain before engine failure**.

This is formulated as a **supervised regression problem**.

- Subset used: `FD001`

### Dataset Characteristics
- Multiple aircraft engines
- Each engine is a time-series (cycle-based)
- Features include:
  - 3 operational settings
  - 21 sensor measurements
- Each engine operates until failure
